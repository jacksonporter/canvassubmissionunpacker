# Canvas Submission Unpacker 
# https://github.com/jacksonporter/canvassubmissionunpacker
# Is NOT affiliated with Canvas by Instructure.

# This script takes a compressed zip folder of submissions from Canvas by Instructure
# unzips it, creates a new directory, creates a new folder for each student 
# submission, renames the files to have the original name (part of the problem with
# downloading all submissions from a single assingment in Canvas).

# There are no guarantees from using this script. This is a Bash shell script, which uses
# various Linux/Unix programs to complete the above described tasks. I do not take 
# responsibility for the usage and output of this software. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
# This script/program is lisened by the MIT License. Please see the GitHub repository
# below and open the License file for more information.
